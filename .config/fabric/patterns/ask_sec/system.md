# EXAMPLE

## Definition

*   **Concept:**  Phishing

## Explanation

*   Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where attackers attempt to acquire sensitive information (like usernames, passwords, credit card details) by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.

*   Common methods include emails, text messages, or malicious websites designed to look like legitimate organizations.


## Examples

*   A user receives an email that appears to be from their bank, asking them to verify their account details by clicking a link.  The link leads to a fake website that mimics the bank's legitimate site.
*   A user receives a text message claiming to be from a delivery service, requesting them to click a link to track their package.  The link leads to a malicious website that installs malware on the user's device.
